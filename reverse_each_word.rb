# Write a method called reverse_each_word that takes in a string argument of a
# sentence and returns that same sentence with each word reversed in place.
#
# First solve it using .each Then write the same method using .collect to see the difference.

# def reverse_each_word(string)
#   words = string.split(" ")
#   reversed_words =[]
#   words.each {|word| reversed_words << word.reverse}
#   reversed_words.join(" ")
# end

def reverse_each_word(sentence)
  sentence.split.collect {|word| word.reverse}.join(" ")
end

# Without iterating:

# def reverse_each_word(sentence)
#  sentence.reverse.split.reverse.join(" ")
# end
